=====ROOMS=====
Rooms are the main way the player navigates through the world. When you are presented with a scene -- the "town square," for example -- you are being shown a room. When you type "go north" to get to the cider brewery, the brewery is another room.
FORMAT:
"room name": {
     "type" : "room",
     "name" : "how the room is described in the directions ('to the east is x...'",
     "exits": {
         "south": "the room name to the south",
         "east": "the room name to the east"
     },
     "entrance_text": "The text that is displayed when you enter the room.",
     
     "actions" : {
        "verb you can do" : {
            "noun you can do the object to" : {"type" : "destination"}
    }

},


EXAMPLE:
"lobby": {
     "type" : "room",
     "name" : "the game lobby",
     "exits": {
         "south": "town_square"
     },
     "entrance_text": "You are in the first room of the new, data-driven world we are c    reating in an attempt to be a halfway intelligent human.",
 
     "actions" : {
        "view" : {
            "menu" : {"menu" : "sample_menu"}
    }
}




=====MENUS=====


FORMAT:
"cider" : {
    "type" : "menu",
    "origin" : "the room the user will be returned to by default"
    "prompt" : "You approach the front desk. The man smiles.\n\t\"Hello!\" he says, \"Welcome to     the Delran Cider Brewery, where apples turn into heaven. What can I do for you?\"",
    "choices" : {
        "1" : "Can you tell me a little about this place?",
        "2" : "Option b, dontchaknow",
        "3" : "The third option."
    },

    "responses" : {
        "1" : {"loop" : "Something to say here.",
              "prompt" : "If you use the LOOP type, it will spit something out and then return the user to the same menu. In this space, you have the option to change what the menu's prompt says, or you can leave it blank."
        },

        "2" : {"final" : "The FINAL response type simply sends a text response here."},

        "3" : {"menu" : "The MENU response type says nothing, then sends the player to a different menu, identified here."}

    }
 
}
