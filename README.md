# Bishop's Map

*A data-driven text adventure engine written in Python. Very much under construction and not particularly usable.*



## About

### The system
Honestly, this whole thing started because I wanted to make a video game for a girl. All I could cobble together at the time was a text game in embarrassingly broken Python, but with a lot of work (and the guidance of several patient friends), I was able to turn thousands of lines of spaghetti code into a system that can parse anybody's game who has the patience to put together the JSON.

Text-based MMORPGs haven't been in vogue for at least a decade. It's been even longer than that in the case of single-player text games, built for a time before graphics cards and computer mice. But interactive fiction done right can still be an amazing experience, and I think any tool that can help facilitate that is a good thing.

My name is Rich. I'm 24, and I'm still trying to figure out why doing this kind of stuff is so much fun.

## Where the name came from
In 1975, Will Crowther built [*Colossal Cave Adventure*](http://rickadams.org/adventure/a_history.html), planting the seeds for 30 years of text-based gaming with a little game about a magical cavern, based on his real-life caving experiences.

The game was set in a section of Kentucky's [Mammoth Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Cave_National_Park), and, according to legend, the game's cave was rendered faithfully enough that players who went to the real cave could find their way around.

One of the first people to find their way around Mammoth Cave, however, was Stephen Bishop, a slave brought to the cave as a guide in 1838. He was the first man to cross the cave's "Bottomless Pit," helping reveal portions of the cave previously unknown. In 1844, he drew a map of the cave, from memory, that was used by explorers for more than 40 years.

Bishop was freed from slavery in 1856, and died of tuberculosis sometime between 1857 and 1859. In 1972, a connection to Mammoth Cave was discovered in the Flint Ridge Cave system, joining it to what is now the longest cave in the world. Revisiting Bishop's map, cavers discovered Bishop had already found and mapped the connection more than a century before.
