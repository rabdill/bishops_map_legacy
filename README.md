# Bishop's Map

A data-driven text adventure engine written in Python. Very much under construction and not particularly usable. All of the things outlined below *do* work, though, and you're welcome to give it a shot.

Just clone the repo into a directory somewhere on your box, and make sure Python is installed â€“ it's been tested with 2.7 but not 3.x. To use the app's core functionality, you should only have to edit the JSON files.
