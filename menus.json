Their soil isn't like the soil anywhere else -- the apples that grow there are bigger and juicier than any we could ever grow here, but there wasn't enough room in town to build a brewery. So the founders came here instead.\n\tDelran was a lot smaller then, of course.

He dismounts from his horse, and you try to put as much room as possible between him and you. He steps slowly up onto the porch, you breathe in to scream. Before you can, however, there is a gunshot, and you see a bullet from somewhere behind the rider burst through his chest and fly away into the square somewhere. He falls to the ground, dead.\n\t\"Marlo!\" you yell. \"Wow... thank you.\"\n\tBefore she can respond, however, the other two riders emerge from the Donutorium.\n\t\"We got it!\" one of them yells, before he realizes his partners are dead. He and the other rider pause and look around for a moment, seeing Marlo in the middle of the square with a smoking pistol. They head for her at the same time, and she hustles to the black rider's horse and jumps on, taking off between two houses and into the woods.\n\tThe two remaining riders don't get out of town before they decide it isn't worth the trouble of navigating the woods this close to dusk.\n\t\"Farewell, and good luck without your precious glaze crystal,\" one of them says, and the riders speed through the gates and out of town.",
